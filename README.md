# State CPI Data Visualizer

This project aims to make it easier to visualize trends in the quarterly state inflation rate by graphing inflation data obtained from Hazell, J., J. Herre&#241;o, E. Nakamura, and J. Steinsson (2020): “The Slope of the Phillips Curve: Evidence from U.S. States”. 

At this time, only the annual inflation rate in the state and year (pi) can be graphed, but the inflation rate for the non-tradeable and tradeable sector will be added next. 

Works for both web and mobile.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
